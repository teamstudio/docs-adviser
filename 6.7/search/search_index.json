It serves as a master list of all databases, templates, users and groups on your servers and all of the other modules in Teamstudio Adviser refer to it. Running a Catalog Scan You run a Catalog Scan from the Servers section of the Settings page. See the relevant documentation for details. Viewing the Catalog After you have run a Catalog Scan, you can view the results by clicking on Catalog on the top navigation bar or by clicking on the Catalog section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Catalog overview page. The overview page shows the largest databases by file size and the largest templates by number of design elements. You can use the buttons next to each chart to control whether the data is shown as a pie chart, a bar chart or a table. The page also shows a summary of the last few scans so that you can see how current your scan data is. You can run a Catalog Scan any time you want to update the data. Viewing Databases To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text. All of the columns are searched, so you can, for example, match on a template name, not just a database path. Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the databases in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Databases button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data, such as by template or by date of last modification. For example, if you group by template, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of templates is shown, along with how many databases use that template. Selecting a template will display a list of those databases. Viewing Database Details To view the catalog details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. You can view details from other modules using the row of buttons above the details. These will switch between Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance details. The last button is used to filter the database - see Filters for details. If the list that you were viewing was grouped then you will see an additional control at the top left of the screen that allows you to navigate through the groups. This control has buttons with left and right arrows that allow you to navigate to the previous and next groups. You can also click on the central text with the group name to select from a dropdown list of all groups. Effective Access Adviser 6.1 adds a new detail section for databases: Effective Access - Users . You can think of this as being a version of the ACL with all of the groups expanded so that you can see exactly which users have been granted access to the database. Effective Access uses standard text to identify users that are explicitly listed in the ACL and italics to identify users that have access to the database via a group. In the example above, Lauren Dowd is explicitly listed in the ACL as a manager. Bella Hemmings is also a manager, but because Manager is displayed in italics, she is not explicitly listed in the ACL with that access level. You can click on a user to navigate to the corresponding user details screen to explore group membership for the user or find out which other databases they can access. For comparison, here is the ACL for the same database. The full list of users with access to a database can grow large and so Adviser breaks the list into pages of up to ten users at a time. You can use the First, Last and arrow buttons to navigate through the pages. Alternatively, the search bar will search the entire list and only display matching users. As always in Adviser, you can also click on the column headers to sort the list by user name or access level. Note Effective Access can generate very large volumes of data in large organizations and is therefore disabled by default from Adviser 6.5 onwards. See the Release Notes for more details. Note Effective Access only lists users named in the ACL, either directly or indirectly via a group. It will not list users that, for example, have access to a database via a Default ACL entry. Business Value At the top of the details view, you will see a dropdown with a diamond icon. This allows you to set a Business Value for a database representing its importance to your organization. The value is set on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 meaning not important and 5 meaning critically important. Business value is an important factor when determining the future of a database as you consolidate servers or migrate your applications and it is a key component in Adviser's guidance recommendations. Keyboard Navigation There are several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate around the details view. Up and Down arrows will move to the previous and next databases in the list. Left and Right arrows will cycle through the different modules. 0-5 will set the business value for the database. Use 1-5 to set the value or 0 to revert to Unknown. Deleted Databases Adviser 6.6 and later marks databases that are no longer found in a server's catalog.nsf as deleted, displaying them with a trashcan icon. Note Deleted status is determined by the documents in catalog.nsf. The server's catalog task must run prior to Adviser's catalog scan for status to update. You can use Filters to hide deleted databases from the Adviser UI. When new databases are created on a server, they do not appear in the server's catalog.nsf until the catalog task has run, normally at night. If an Adviser scan is run and there are new databases found in the usage data scanned, Adviser will create an entry for the database, but will mark it as deleted since it was not found in the catalog. These databases will also contain a message to this effect. Once these databases appear in the catalog.nsf in a subsequent Adviser scan, the deleted status and the message will be removed. Databases that were deleted prior to the first time a server was scanned, but that were found in usage during the initial scan, will also display this message. Databases that Adviser knows were in the catalog at some point in time will not show this message. Viewing Users To view a list of users, return to the Catalog overview screen and click the Users button. By default, this will display a list of all of the users in all scanned address books. Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the users in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Users button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data. For example, if you group by Group Membership, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of address book groups is shown, along with the number of users in each group. Selecting a group will display those users. Note that Adviser automatically expand out all nested groups and so the list of users includes not only users explicitly named in the group but also users contained in any nested groups. Viewing User Details To view the catalog details for a user, simply select the user from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the user list on the left and the details of the selected user on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the user. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Understanding Group Membership The Groups section for a user shows all of groups that a user belongs to. If a user is explicitly named in a group then the group name will be shown in standard text. If a user is indirectly in a group as a result of belonging to another group then the group name will be shown in italics . For example, in the screen above, Gordon Hudson is explicitly named in the US Admin group because 'US Admin' is displayed in standard text. On the line underneath, he is shown as indirectly belonging to the Administrators group because Administrators is displayed in italics. The second column, titled 'Via' explains why: the Administrators group contains the US Admin group. Similarly, on the next line, he is in the Groupshield Administrators group because that contains the Administrators group. If you only want to see the groups that explicitly contain the user then you can use the toggle at the top of the section to switch from All groups to Explicit Only groups. Note Group data will only be available if Effective Access is enabled. Please see the Release Notes for further details. Effective Access In addition to group membership, Adviser shows you all databases that list a user in the ACL either directly or via a group. This is in the Effective Access - Databases section. The access level that the user has to the database is show in regular text if the user is explicitly listed in the ACL and in italics if the access is via a group. So in the example above, the user is listed in the ACL for Audit6/adviser.nsf as a Manager. The user also has manager access to mailarchive/a_apeter.nsf although they are not explicitly listed as such in the ACL. You can click on a database name to navigate to that database to explore the ACL or find out which other users have access to that database. Note Effective Access can generate very large volumes of data in large organizations and is therefore disabled by default from Adviser 6.5 onwards. See the Release Notes for more details. Note Effective Access only lists databases that contain the user in the ACL, either directly or via a group. It does not list databases that the user has access to, for example, via a Default ACL entry.","title":"Catalog"},{"location":"catalog/#catalog","text":"The Catalog module imports information from Domino server catalogs and address books.

The module combines a number of different factors such as the number of design elements of different types, the presence of certain hard-to-migrate elements and the presence of user-definable keywords to compute a complexity score. That score is then converted to a five-point complexity ranking from Very Low to Very High. Running a Complexity Scan If enabled, Teamstudio Adviser will automatically run a complexity scan after running a catalog scan. Subsequent scans will only analyze databases whose design has changed since the last scan. Note Complexity scanning is initially disabled as a full complexity scan may take many days in a large environment. We recommend making sure that your keywords have been fully configured before enabling complexity scanning since changing the keywords will require another full scan. Viewing Complexity After you have run a Complexity Scan, you can view the results by clicking on Complexity on the top navigation bar or by clicking on the Complexity section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Complexity overview page. The overview page shows databases categorized by the complexity ranking and an indication of which types of complexity (e.g. script libraries, keywords) are contributing most to your overall environment. To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text. All of the columns are searched, so you can, for example, match on a database title, not just a database path. Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the databases in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Databases button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data, such as by template or by complexity. For example, if you group by complexity, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of complexity ranks is shown, along with how many databases have that ranking. Selecting a ranking will display a list of those databases. Note Some databases have a complexity ranking of n/a. This occurs when Adviser cannot access the database to analyze it. Common reasons for this are that the workstation running the complexity scan may not have sufficient permissions to open the database or the database may have been deleted. Viewing Database Details To view the complexity details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Complexity Analysis The Complexity Analysis section shows how Adviser computed the complexity score. In the example above, the database has a complexity score of 69 which is ranked as Very High . The thresholds that Adviser uses to convert scores to ranks have been set after working with many customers over many years, but if they don't make sense for your organization then it is possible to customize them. See the Complexity section under Settings for details. The Complexity Score is computed by assigning a complexity score to each type of complexity (e.g. the presence of script libraries) and then summing the scores. In the bar chart above, for example, you can see that Script Libraries are contributing a score of 20 whereas Folders are contributing a score of 4. Summing all the scores in the chart gives the total, 69. Common Problems The Common Problems section shows which common problems were encountered in the database, along with a count of how many design elements were affected by each one. These common problems represent Domino features that are difficult to recreate in other development environments. While we recommend using the full default set, you can configure which common problems to include in the Complexity section of the Settings page. See the relevant documentation for details. Changing this setting does not require running a new scan since Complexity always collects counts for all of the common problems. You can view details from other modules using the row of buttons above the details. These will switch between Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance details. The last button is used to filter the database - see Filters for details. If the list that you were viewing was grouped then you will see an additional control at the top left of the screen that allows you to navigate through the groups.

Note that Adviser always collects data except Complexity for all databases and users; filters only affect what data is displayed. Consequently, you can edit filters at any time to add and remove additional databases and Adviser will be able to accurately display data, including historical usage trends. Note As of Adviser 6.7.0, filtering a database prevents the Complexity Scan from creating/updating complexity information for that database to improve performance. Complexity information is not discarded if it has been collected previously. A message is displayed on the Complexity panel for a database when complexity information is out of date, or has not been recorded because of filtering. Excluding a Database You can create a filter to exclude a database from the database details view in any module. With the required database selected, click the 'no entry' button that is next to the module buttons. This will display the filter menu. The filter menu will let you ignore this specific database on the current server, this database pathname on any server, the folder in which the database resides (if applicable), all replicas of this database or all databases inheriting from the same template as this database, if appropriate. If you select a template, the filter menu will only offer the option of filtering all databases inheriting from the template: modules other than the catalog never display data for templates in any case. When you filter a database, Adviser needs to recompute all of the usage counts for all users in the system. This may take a little while so it runs as a background job. It may therefore take a little while before you see the results of the filter operation: see the Jobs page for further details. Deleted databases can be filtered by selecting a database marked deleted, and choosing the filter All deleted databases . Filtering deleted databases will remove them from from usage counts and other modules, for a cleaner view of the applications that are still in active use. Deleted database filters can be removed using using the procedure below. Removing Filters using the Catalog The databases list in the Catalog shows all databases but marks any that are filtered with a filter icon. If you click on a filtered database, the details view will show the filters that apply to the database and allow you to remove them individually. Removing Filters using Settings You can view a list of all filters in effect and remove any that are no longer required from the settings page, accessed from the gear icon in the status bar.

Usage data can only be imported if the Usage Auditor application's server configurations were set to Save Supporting Data during data collection. Adviser relies on the full detail of the supporting data files to enable advanced filtering options. Requirements Adviser imports usage collected in previous versions of Usage Auditor using the source files that Usage Auditor collected during scans to create usage reports. Usage Auditor only saves these source files for servers where the server configuration was configured to Save Supporting Data . This setting appears on the server documents and can be viewed by going to Admin > Server Configuration in the Usage Auditor database. In order to import usage, the following conditions must be met. Usage Auditor was configured to Save Supporting Data during scans. A copy of the Usage Auditor database is available on the Adviser workstation (the Notes client workstation configured to process jobs for the desired instance of Adviser.) All servers defined in Usage Auditor have also been defined in Adviser. All servers to be imported must be successfully cataloged by Adviser scans prior to import (see Skipping Servers below for information on limiting what is imported.) Adviser supports importing the file formats from Usage Auditor versions 4 and 5. Note It is important to verify that all servers for which data will be imported have been successfully scanned by Adviser prior to importing. If Usage Auditor contains usage data for servers that are enabled in Adviser but have never been cataloged by Adviser, all databases will be created, however they will be marked as deleted, and minimal catalog information will be available for those databases. Additionally, the proper resolution of HTTP requests to databases depends on a prior catalog scan. A subsequent scan of the server will correctly update deleted status for NSF access, but web usage data cannot be corrected. Creating a backup of the Adviser database prior to importing Usage Auditor data is recommended. Verifying Saved Supporting Data Usage Auditor contains a view, Supporting Data , that can be accessed from the View > Go To menu. This view contains the raw files that Adviser will import. The view is categorized on the date on which the data was collected, and the attachment names listed in the view include the name of the server from which the data was collected. Adviser will import data for the date ranges available in this view. To limit the amount of data imported to Adviser, make a copy of Usage Auditor and delete older entries as desired. Gaps in the dates of these files indicate that either Save Supporting Data was disabled during the time of the gap, or Usage collection failed to run (e.g. due to the Usage workstation being shut off.) In Usage Auditor 5.x, data is collected for all available activity on the server since the last successful scan; gaps smaller than 10 days should not represent missing data. In 4.x, data was collected nightly for the prior day only. If there are significant gaps (more than 10 days in 5.x), limiting the import to the data available after the gaps will improve accuracy, but shorten the reporting period. Skipping Servers Adviser requires all servers in the import data to be defined in Adviser and successfully scanned prior to import. If the Usage Auditor data to be imported contains data for servers that are no longer available, or that otherwise should not be imported, create server definitions for those servers in Adviser, and disable them. Importing Usage Auditor Data Use the following steps to import Usage Auditor data into Adviser. 1. Create a backup copy of the Adviser database; in the event of a failure or misconfiguration, a backup can be used to restore Adviser. 2. Copy the Usage Auditor database to the Adviser workstation client. 3. Review the Supporting Data view in Usage Auditor (as described above.) 4. Create server definitions in Adviser to match Usage Auditor, if needed. Disable any servers that should not be imported. 5. Run an Adviser scan (from the Settings > Servers page of the Adviser browser UI), and verify that it completes successfully. 6. Open the Adviser server application in the Notes client on the Adviser Workstation, and start the import by choosing the Usage Auditor database via Actions > Upgrade / Reimport Usage . The import operation will run as an Adviser job (similar to scans triggered in the UI), and can be monitored in the browser UI by reloading the browser app. If the import is not successful, Adviser can be restored from the backup copy. Note, however, that additional operations are required to reset the Usage statistics in SQL tables that Adviser uses to generate Usage information. For more information, contact Teamstudio support at techsupport@teamstudio.com . Importing Both 4.x and 5.x Usage Auditor Usage Notes and Domino timestamps are stored with 100th of a second precision, and Usage Auditor 5.x records server activity with that same precision. Adviser uses the timestamp of activity, precise to the 100th of a second, to guarantee the uniqueness the activity it records and imports. It is therefore safe to import overlapping usage data from 5.x as the timestamp constraint prevents duplication. Usage Auditor 4.x collected activity from the Domino server with a timestamp granularity of whole seconds.

The Adviser server application provides Adviser's browser-based user interface, generates reports on databases and users for the Adviser modules, and stores all data collected by Adviser. Adviser server is deployed by creating an NSF based the template TSAdviser.ntf on the desired server, and configuring it via web browser. The Adviser Workstation is responsible for collecting the data that forms the basis for the reports generated by the Adviser server. Adviser Workstation is deployed by running an installer (contained in the server NSF) on a workstation installation of HCL Notes. The installed program is configured by the installer to connect to the Adviser server, and remains running to process Adviser scans as needed. Scans are resource intensive processes; running scans from a client workstation limits the impact of Adviser on server performance, and allows easier configuration and access to servers in multiple domains. Upgrading an Existing Installation If you are upgrading an existing installation of Adviser 6.0 or above, you can skip directly to the upgrading section. Otherwise continue to follow the instructions below. HCL Domino Server System Requirements Teamstudio Adviser is supported on all HCL-supported Notes/Domino versions.** The web interface for Teamstudio Adviser can be hosted on Domino servers with the HTTP task enabled. For Domino 8.5.3, the server must have a minimum of Fix Pack 3 installed, and must have Upgrade Pack 1 installed (or equivalent version of the Xpages Extension Library). The required components are included in Domino 9.0 and greater; no additional components are required. The Adviser Workstation can be run on a Notes Client version 8.5.3 and higher (32-bit) running on supported versions of Microsoft Windows. We recommend the most recent Fix Pack version also be installed on the HCL Notes workstation. ** Adviser is known to run well in most 8.5.3+ Notes/Domino environments, however, Teamstudio support may be limited regarding issues related to unsupported versions of Notes or Domino. Prerequisites for Usage Data Collection The Usage module of Adviser aggregates and reports on data collected by the HCL Domino server\u2019s Activity Logging task. In order to use Usage Auditor, Activity Logging will need to be enabled and running on the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned by the Adviser application. Below are the instructions for enabling Activity Logging for your HCL Domino server(s): Open the Domino Directory on the server(s) that will be scanned by Teamstudio Adviser. Navigate to the View Configuration -> Servers -> Configurations . If a document already exists for the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned then place the document into Edit mode. If there is not a document for the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned then click the \u201cAdd Configuration\u201d Action button. If this is a new document then list the HCL Domino server(s) the will be scanned by Teamstudio Adviser. If you are intending on scanning multiple HCL Domino servers then you can list them all here. Switch to the Activity Logging tab and ensure that Activity Logging is enabled. In the \u201cEnabled logging types\u201d field ensure that the following options are selected: Domino.AGENT Domino.HTTP Domino.Notes.Database Domino.Notes.Session Save and close the document. This will also enable the Activity Logging task on the HCL Domino server(s) that you listed. If you listed multiple HCL Domino servers on the document you must make sure that the Domino Directory is replicated to the additional servers. By default, Activity Logging is stored the log.nsf database on the HCL Domino server, and the retention period for log.nsf applies to activity as well. By default, Adviser will collect usage data every night and will import any new data. If collection fails, no data will be lost as long as the problem is resolved within the retention period. Installing and Configuring Teamstudio Adviser Application Acquiring the Teamstudio Adviser Application Template The Teamstudio Adviser application is comprised of two parts. The Teamstudio Adviser Domino application file (.NSF.) The Teamstudio Adviser Workstation client (command line interface.) Both of these parts are contained within an HCL Domino Template file which can be obtained from the Teamstudio Website at the following URL: https://www.teamstudio.com/adviser-download-page . Creating the Teamstudio Adviser Application Once you have acquired the Teamstudio Adviser application template, you can create the Teamstudio Adviser application where the data will be stored. This is a simple process to perform by following the steps below. Move the template file into your HCL Notes Client\u2019s Data directory. From your HCL Notes Client select the following menu option File -> Application -> New... . In the dialog that is presented, enter the following information. Server Select the server where you wish to place the Adviser application. Title This is normally Teamstudio Adviser . File name This is normally TSAdviser.nsf . You can also indicate a subdirectory at the beginning of the file name (e.g., Teamstudio\\TSAdviser.nsf .) Template Select the Teamstudio Adviser template from the list. Once these options have been entered you can press OK to create the application. Once the application has been created it will automatically launch into your HCL Notes client. You may receive a Certificate Warning message. This is due to the fact that the design of the Teamstudio Adviser application is currently signed by a Teamstudio ID. To re-sign with your organization\u2019s Notes Signature follow the steps below. Open your HCL Domino Administrator application. Switch to the HCL Domino server where you created the Teamstudio Adviser application. From the Files tab, locate the Teamstudio Adviser application. Right click on the Teamstudio Adviser application and select Sign... In the dialog that is presented, select either Active User\u2019s ID if you are using a Notes ID which has the ability to properly sign designs on the server or optionally select Active Server\u2019s ID to sign the design with the HCL Domino server\u2019s ID file. Click OK to complete the process. Design signing on the HCL Domino server will take approximately 1-5 minutes. If installation is successful, you should see the application home screen similar to the image below. Transaction Logging If Domino Transaction Logging is enabled on the server where the Adviser server NSF is deployed, be sure to disable it for the Adviser database by checking Disable transaction logging in the Advanced tab of the database properties dialog. Transaction Logging is not needed for adviser since scans can be safely repeated if there is an error or outage. Enabling transaction logging may cause problems on the server, since the large number of updates Adviser makes while updating its documents can cause the transaction logs to hit size limits. Access Control List (ACL) By default, Teamstudio Adviser server requires that the ACL entry Anonymous be defined as No Access and given the privilege Read Public Documents \u2013 this setting allows the Adviser workstation to trigger server-side job processing when client-side jobs have completed. Anonymous access cannot be used to create jobs or access data. Anonymous should not be set to a higher level of access, as authentication is required by the Adviser services that support the web browser application. Allowing anonymous higher levels of access will prevent the server from requiring authentication. If the environment does not allow Anonymous access (for example, it is prohibited at the server level via the Directory's Server document), it is possible to configure Adviser to store and use an HTTP Username/Password combination for this access. For more information, contact Teamstudio support at techsupport@teamstudio.com. In general, other ACL settings in Adviser are applied to the browser application in the same manner they are applied in traditional Notes applications. The -Default- access setting can be used to assign any level of access desired in place of anonymous access. Scheduling Daily Scans Since Adviser extracts activity data from the server's log.nsf, which typically keeps 7-10 days of data, it is important to run Usage Scans on a regular basis to ensure the data is up-to-date and without gaps. To ensure that overnight scans occur, within the Teamstudio Adviser application there is a scheduled agent that needs to be enabled. To enable this Scheduled Agent follow the steps below. Locate the newly created Teamstudio Adviser application on you HCL Notes Workspace. Right click on the Teamstudio Adviser application and from the menu that is presented select Application -> Go To Agents . In the list of Agents, locate and select the agent Scheduled Nightly Scan . At the top of the Agents list, click on the button labeled Enable . You can now close your HCL Domino Designer. By default, this agent will run once daily, at 1:00 AM. The run time can be modified to another time if desired. The Schedule Nightly Scan agent initiates the same process as triggering a manual scan using the Scan Now button in the application. The scan will update Catalog information, import Usage since the last scan, and recalculate any affected metrics. Workstation processing must be enabled for the scan request to be processed. Configuration The final step in configuring the Teamstudio Adviser server is to select the servers to scan. You can do this from the Settings page in the web application, accessed via the gear icon on the right of the Adviser navigation bar. See Servers for more details. Installing the Adviser Workstation HCL Notes Client Workstation Prerequisites In order for the Teamstudio Adviser application to collect the data from your HTML Domino server(s) an application must be installed onto a computer where an HCL Notes Client is also installed. This computer will require the following HCL Notes Client configuration. Version V8.5.3 with the most recent Fix Pack, Version 9.0.1 with a minimum of Fix Pack 6, or any newer version. Authenticated with a Notes ID file which has Full Administration access to the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned and where the Teamstudio Adviser application will reside. The Security option Don\u2019t prompt for a password from other Notes-based programs enabled. This setting can be located under the HCL Notes menu File -> Security -> User Security... . Note Due to the complexity of the Teamstudio Adviser Workstation client\u2019s scanning tasks it is highly recommended that a dedicated computer, either physical or virtual, is used. The computer that is chosen must also be able to remain running without any restarts or being logged off for 24 hours/day 7 days /week. The Adviser Workstation application is an executable application that run scans from a client workstation. Scanning for and reporting on activity is a resource intensive activity that may access multiple servers and works with file system files as part of the process. The data collected during the Workstation scans is written to the server application, and available via the web browser interface. Adviser Workstation is intended to run continuously, as it monitors the Adviser Server component, waiting for scans to be scheduled. The application must be run by an ID that has a least Reader access to the log.nsf files on the servers to be scanned, as well as any applications for which Complexity data is desired. If the servers exist in multiple domains, the ID and local workstation must be properly cross-certified to all servers. The ID must also have Editor level ACL access (with delete rights) to the Adviser Server application. Installation On the computer where the Adviser workstation will run, log in to the HCL Notes client with the ID that will be used to collect data. Ensure that the Notes client setting Don't prompt for password from other Notes-based programs is checked ( File > Security > User Security... ). This step is required to allow the Adviser Workstation application to run. Open the Adviser server application in the Notes client, and click on the link to enable workstation processing in the section titled Adviser Workstation. The Adviser Workstation installer program will launch. Follow the prompts to install the program. During setup, a settings page will be shown which contains configuration information for the Adviser Workstation and its connection to the server. Verify the information is correct. When the installation is complete, the installer will offer to launch the Adviser Workstation application. Launching the Adviser Workstation Once installed, the Adviser Workstation can be launched by clicking the same link used to install it, found in the Configuration page of the Adviser application in the section titled Adviser Workstation . The Adviser Workstation can also be launched by running the executable Workstation.exe, which is installed by default at <Program Files (x86)>\\Teamstudio\\Adviser Workstation\\Workstation.exe Once launched, the Adviser Workstation application window should open, and begin monitoring for pending scans. Note The Adviser Workstation application needs to continue running at all times to ensure that the scanning processes run to completion. These run every day at 1AM (server time). In order to provide an accurate representation of the User Usage for the HCL Domino server(s) being scanned we recommend that this continue for a minimum of 30 days. Server Connectivity The Adviser Workstation requires connectivity to the Adviser server via HTTP. Most workstation processing, including scanning servers and databases, and writing data to the Adviser server, is handled through the Notes client and NRPC. In order to trigger server processing once client side jobs have completed, Adviser invokes a REST service endpoint via HTTP to ensure that the server application is running to process the updated data. The default workstation configuration attempts to connect to the server based on the fully-qualified host name specified first in the server document in the server's address book. The connection is attempted without SSL on port 80. For servers requiring SSL connections, or connectivity on an alternate port, the configuration can be modified by editing the HTTP Host Name field in the Workstation Configuration document in the workstation database. By default this field contains only the host name, but a protocol and optional port name can be specified (for example, https://teamstudio.com:499 specifies SSL on port 499). The Notes client acting as the Adviser Workstation must be exited completely and restarted for this setting to take effect. For help configuring these settings, contact Teamstudio support. Due to limitations with the Java 6 JVM currently embedded in Notes, SSL that use large key sizes may not work correctly. If Anonymous connections are disallowed on the server hosting Adviser, the Workstation can be optionally configured to use HTTP authentication credentials. The user name and password used for login are reversibly hashed to prevent casual access, and stored in a Notes database locally on the workstation in fields encryped with the current ID. To enable the use of authentication, use the command \"http auth\" from the workstation console ( help http auth prints command usage.) Console Commands The Adviser Workstation supports a limited number of administrative commands from the console. To view a list of enabled commands, type help at the console. If additional usage information has been provided for a command, typing help <command> will display it. Upgrading Adviser To upgrade from a previous version of Adviser 6.0 or greater, follow the steps below. Upgrade Adviser Server Sign the new template with the appropriate ID to execute code on the target server. Refresh the design of the server Adviser database from the new template. Restart the HTTP task on the server using the command restart task http . This is equivalent to quit http followed by load http - note that tell http restart will not fully release the JVM and update the new code. Upgrade Adviser Workstation 6.2 or later Exit the Adviser Workstation application, if running. Uninstall Adviser Workstation from the Windows Add / Remove Programs control panel. Install the new Adviser Workstation from the Configuration page in the Adviser server NSF, following the instructions above Upgrade Adviser Workstation 6.1 or earlier The Adviser Workstation install prior to 6.2 ran the workstation component as a locally scheduled agent in the Notes client, from the Notes application TSAdviserWS.nsf located in the root of the Notes data directory. To upgrade, follow these steps. Exit the Notes client acting as the workstation completely (this can be confirmed using task manager). Delete TSAdviserWs.nsf from the client's data directory. Restart the Notes client and open the Adviser Server application. Follow the instructions above for installing Adviser Workstation. In the browser UI, schedule a new scan. This will update the data as needed for the new version, and enable any new features. It is safe to schedule a scan while waiting for the workstation to restart; the scan will begin once the workstation is active. If you have been running a previous Beta version of Adviser Workstation 6.2, which runs as a command-line application, exit the application and install the new Workstation application by following the instructions above. Depending on the version, you may be prompted to uninstall Adviser Workstation via Windows' Programs and Features control panel prior to installing the new version. Browsers and Saved Passwords Adviser does not currently support using saved passwords in browsers. Previously saved passwords can be removed via the browser's settings page.

Catalog The Catalog module reads information from your Domino server catalogs and address books to provide core lists of databases, templates, users and groups. You can use the catalog to browse your databases by name, server, template or how recently they have been modified. You can use the Effective Access feature to determine which users have access to which databases even when the ACL contains complex group structures. In addition to information pulled from the server catalog, this module also allows you to set a Business Value, from 1-5, for each database trapping its importance to your organization. Lastly, the catalog module allows you to configure filters to exclude certain databases and users from the other modules. More details are available in the catalog documentation. Usage The Usage module imports usage information from your Domino server logs and displays detailed usage statistics for both users and databases. For a database, you can see how many times it was accessed and by whom, along with historical trends showing whether the usage is increasing or decreasing. For a user, you can see which databases and servers they accessed. More details are available in the usage documentation. Complexity The Complexity module scans the complete designs of the databases on your servers and generates a complexity score from 1-5 measuring the approximate difficulty of migrating this application to another platform.

See the Fix List section below for details. Please read the installation guide (available here ) carefully before installing. New Features Directory Support in Filters The parent directory of a selected database can now be filtered using the Filter button dropdown, allowing the filter to be applied to all databases in the directory on the current server or on all servers. See Filters for more information on filtering. Complexity and Filtered Databases When databases are filtered in Adviser, the complexity scan will no longer create/update complexity information for those databases. Combined with directory filtering, this can be a huge performance benefit during initial scans. This operation is non-destructive; complexity data is not discarded, out-dated complexity information is flagged in the UI, and removing the filter can allow complexity to be updated in future scans. Log UI Improvements The Logs pane in the browser app has been improved to show stack traces when clicking on error messages, display more accurate by-date grouping across time zones, and to better allow copying of text in log entries. Upgrading Upgrading from Adviser 6.x Upgrading Adviser involves refreshing or replacing the design of the server database, updating the command-line module on the workstation and restarting the server's HTTP task. See Upgrading Adviser on the installation page for a detailed list of steps. Upgrading from Adviser 5.x It is possible to upgrade from Usage Auditor 5.0 and retain all collected Usage data. Note that data collected with versions of Usage Auditor prior to 5.0 cannot be imported into Adviser. To ensure a successful upgrade, please contact our tech support team for help with your migration. Running Adviser and Usage Auditor If you are evaluating Adviser, you may want to run Adviser and Usage Auditor in parallel. This is supported but you will need to run them on separate workstations. The Adviser workstation database contains a long-running scheduled agent that detects job requests on the server and this agent will not allow Usage Auditor's agent to run. Known Issues An error message from HSQL will be recorded in the server log whenever Adviser updates usage data. This message is benign, it refers to HSQL being unable to adjust logging levels, due to Domino JVM policy. It starts with the messages <clinit> failure initializing JDK logging system. Continuing without Application logging. HTTP JVM: java.security.AccessControlException: Access denied (java.util.logging.LoggingPermission control) Allowing the browser to \"save password\" may cause errors in the browser UI on some browsers/platforms. See the installation page for details. During Complexity Scans, the Adviser Workstation may log warnings indicating that \"Notes initialization failed\" due to reuse of a process ID. Normally these warnings are harmless; the Workstation will recover and continue processing.

It allows you to view information about how much your databases are being used and who is using them. It distinguishes between web and client usage and also separates usage by individual users from usage by agents or servers. Running Usage Scan The Domino server only retains usage information for fourteen days so it is important that you run usage scans regularly to import the data before it is lost. The installation section explains how to configure Teamstudio Adviser to run a usage scan every night. Viewing Usage Data To view usage data, select Usage from the top navigation bar or click on the Usage section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Usage overview page. This shows the databases with the most usage and the most active users, along with the last few scans. You can use the buttons next to each chart to view the data as a pie chart, a bar chart or a table. You can use the scan history to verify that your servers are being scanned successfully. Viewing Database Usage To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text. All of the columns are searched, so you can, for example, match on a database title, not just a database path. The counts in the table are defined as follows. | Column Name | Description | |---|---| | User Total | The total number of hits for the database by users i.e. excluding hits from servers and agents. This is the sum of the Notes and Web columns. | | Notes | The number of times the database was used by users from a Notes client. This is a count of sessions : when a user opens a database, interacts with it from the Notes client and then closes it, that counts as a single session. | | Web | The number of times the database was accessed by users via HTTP. Since HTTP does not have a concept of sessions, this is a count of individual database accesses. For example, opening a page to view a single document might involve several database accesses to retrieve graphics stored as image resources in the database. Therefore the counts in this column tend to be significantly larger than the counts in the Notes column. | | Days | The number of unique days on which the database was accessed by at least one user. Again, server and agent hits are excluded. | | Users | The number of unique users who accessed the database. | Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the databases in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Databases button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data, such as by template or by server. For example, if you group by template, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of templates is shown, along with how many databases use that template. Selecting a template will display a list of those databases. Grouping by Replica ID Databases in Usage views can also be grouped by Replica ID, to give a clearer picture of database usage across multiple replicating servers. When this option is enabled, the server column will display the number of servers the database was found on, and the row will show combined usage totals for all replicas. The file name and title, if not identical on all replicas, will also show the number of replicas. Clicking on this row will expand it so that statistics for individual replicas can be viewed. Viewing Database Usage Details To view the usage details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Usage Counts The Usage Counts section, shown above, shows the counts available from the table along with additional counts for database accesses by agents and by servers. Users The Users section shows which users have accessed the database. The count, 48 in the screenshot, shows how many different users have accessed the database. Agents The Agents section shows which agents have accessed the database. The count, 1 in the screenshot, shows how many different agents have accessed the database. Trends The Trends section shows historical monthly counts for notes and web database access by users. As usual, server and agent accesses are excluded from these counts. You can view details from other modules using the row of buttons above the details. These will switch between Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance details. The last button is used to filter the database - see Filters for details. If the list that you were viewing was grouped then you will see an additional control at the top left of the screen that allows you to navigate through the groups. This control has buttons with left and right arrows that allow you to navigate to the previous and next groups. You can also click on the central text with the group name to select from a dropdown list of all groups. Keyboard Navigation There are several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate around the details view. Up and Down arrows will move to the previous and next databases in the list. Left and Right arrows will cycle through the different modules. Viewing User Usage To view a list of users, click the Users button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the users with any recorded database access. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to users matching the search text. The counts in the table are defined as follows. | Column Name | Description | |---|---| | Total Hits | The total number of database accesses recorded for this user. See the database section above for details on how these this count is computed. | | Servers Accessed | The number of different servers accessed by this user. | | Last Access | The last day on which activity was found for this user. | Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the users in various ways.

It serves as a master list of all databases, templates, users and groups on your servers and all of the other modules in Teamstudio Adviser refer to it. Running a Catalog Scan You run a Catalog Scan from the Servers section of the Settings page. See the relevant documentation for details. Viewing the Catalog After you have run a Catalog Scan, you can view the results by clicking on Catalog on the top navigation bar or by clicking on the Catalog section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Catalog overview page. The overview page shows the largest databases by file size and the largest templates by number of design elements. You can use the buttons next to each chart to control whether the data is shown as a pie chart, a bar chart or a table. The page also shows a summary of the last few scans so that you can see how current your scan data is. You can run a Catalog Scan any time you want to update the data. Viewing Databases To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text.

For example, if you group by template, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of templates is shown, along with how many databases use that template. Selecting a template will display a list of those databases. Viewing Database Details To view the catalog details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. You can view details from other modules using the row of buttons above the details. These will switch between Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance details. The last button is used to filter the database - see Filters for details. If the list that you were viewing was grouped then you will see an additional control at the top left of the screen that allows you to navigate through the groups. This control has buttons with left and right arrows that allow you to navigate to the previous and next groups. You can also click on the central text with the group name to select from a dropdown list of all groups. Effective Access Adviser 6.1 adds a new detail section for databases: Effective Access - Users . You can think of this as being a version of the ACL with all of the groups expanded so that you can see exactly which users have been granted access to the database. Effective Access uses standard text to identify users that are explicitly listed in the ACL and italics to identify users that have access to the database via a group. In the example above, Lauren Dowd is explicitly listed in the ACL as a manager. Bella Hemmings is also a manager, but because Manager is displayed in italics, she is not explicitly listed in the ACL with that access level. You can click on a user to navigate to the corresponding user details screen to explore group membership for the user or find out which other databases they can access. For comparison, here is the ACL for the same database. The full list of users with access to a database can grow large and so Adviser breaks the list into pages of up to ten users at a time. You can use the First, Last and arrow buttons to navigate through the pages. Alternatively, the search bar will search the entire list and only display matching users. As always in Adviser, you can also click on the column headers to sort the list by user name or access level. Note Effective Access can generate very large volumes of data in large organizations and is therefore disabled by default from Adviser 6.5 onwards. See the Release Notes for more details. Note Effective Access only lists users named in the ACL, either directly or indirectly via a group. It will not list users that, for example, have access to a database via a Default ACL entry. Business Value At the top of the details view, you will see a dropdown with a diamond icon. This allows you to set a Business Value for a database representing its importance to your organization. The value is set on a scale of 1 to 5 with 1 meaning not important and 5 meaning critically important. Business value is an important factor when determining the future of a database as you consolidate servers or migrate your applications and it is a key component in Adviser's guidance recommendations. Keyboard Navigation There are several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate around the details view. Up and Down arrows will move to the previous and next databases in the list. Left and Right arrows will cycle through the different modules. 0-5 will set the business value for the database. Use 1-5 to set the value or 0 to revert to Unknown. Deleted Databases Adviser 6.6 and later marks databases that are no longer found in a server's catalog.nsf as deleted, displaying them with a trashcan icon. Note Deleted status is determined by the documents in catalog.nsf. The server's catalog task must run prior to Adviser's catalog scan for status to update. You can use Filters to hide deleted databases from the Adviser UI. When new databases are created on a server, they do not appear in the server's catalog.nsf until the catalog task has run, normally at night. If an Adviser scan is run and there are new databases found in the usage data scanned, Adviser will create an entry for the database, but will mark it as deleted since it was not found in the catalog. These databases will also contain a message to this effect. Once these databases appear in the catalog.nsf in a subsequent Adviser scan, the deleted status and the message will be removed. Databases that were deleted prior to the first time a server was scanned, but that were found in usage during the initial scan, will also display this message. Databases that Adviser knows were in the catalog at some point in time will not show this message. Viewing Users To view a list of users, return to the Catalog overview screen and click the Users button. By default, this will display a list of all of the users in all scanned address books. Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the users in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Users button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data. For example, if you group by Group Membership, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of address book groups is shown, along with the number of users in each group. Selecting a group will display those users. Note that Adviser automatically expand out all nested groups and so the list of users includes not only users explicitly named in the group but also users contained in any nested groups. Viewing User Details To view the catalog details for a user, simply select the user from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the user list on the left and the details of the selected user on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the user. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Understanding Group Membership The Groups section for a user shows all of groups that a user belongs to. If a user is explicitly named in a group then the group name will be shown in standard text. If a user is indirectly in a group as a result of belonging to another group then the group name will be shown in italics . For example, in the screen above, Gordon Hudson is explicitly named in the US Admin group because 'US Admin' is displayed in standard text. On the line underneath, he is shown as indirectly belonging to the Administrators group because Administrators is displayed in italics. The second column, titled 'Via' explains why: the Administrators group contains the US Admin group. Similarly, on the next line, he is in the Groupshield Administrators group because that contains the Administrators group. If you only want to see the groups that explicitly contain the user then you can use the toggle at the top of the section to switch from All groups to Explicit Only groups. Note Group data will only be available if Effective Access is enabled. Please see the Release Notes for further details. Effective Access In addition to group membership, Adviser shows you all databases that list a user in the ACL either directly or via a group. This is in the Effective Access - Databases section. The access level that the user has to the database is show in regular text if the user is explicitly listed in the ACL and in italics if the access is via a group. So in the example above, the user is listed in the ACL for Audit6/adviser.nsf as a Manager. The user also has manager access to mailarchive/a_apeter.nsf although they are not explicitly listed as such in the ACL. You can click on a database name to navigate to that database to explore the ACL or find out which other users have access to that database. Note Effective Access can generate very large volumes of data in large organizations and is therefore disabled by default from Adviser 6.5 onwards. See the Release Notes for more details. Note Effective Access only lists databases that contain the user in the ACL, either directly or via a group. It does not list databases that the user has access to, for example, via a Default ACL entry.","title":"Catalog"},{"location":"ja/catalog/#catalog","text":"The Catalog module imports information from Domino server catalogs and address books.

The module combines a number of different factors such as the number of design elements of different types, the presence of certain hard-to-migrate elements and the presence of user-definable keywords to compute a complexity score. That score is then converted to a five-point complexity ranking from Very Low to Very High. Running a Complexity Scan If enabled, Teamstudio Adviser will automatically run a complexity scan after running a catalog scan. Subsequent scans will only analyze databases whose design has changed since the last scan. Note Complexity scanning is initially disabled as a full complexity scan may take many days in a large environment. We recommend making sure that your keywords have been fully configured before enabling complexity scanning since changing the keywords will require another full scan. Viewing Complexity After you have run a Complexity Scan, you can view the results by clicking on Complexity on the top navigation bar or by clicking on the Complexity section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Complexity overview page. The overview page shows databases categorized by the complexity ranking and an indication of which types of complexity (e.g. script libraries, keywords) are contributing most to your overall environment. To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text.

For example, if you group by complexity, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of complexity ranks is shown, along with how many databases have that ranking. Selecting a ranking will display a list of those databases. Note Some databases have a complexity ranking of n/a. This occurs when Adviser cannot access the database to analyze it. Common reasons for this are that the workstation running the complexity scan may not have sufficient permissions to open the database or the database may have been deleted. Viewing Database Details To view the complexity details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Complexity Analysis The Complexity Analysis section shows how Adviser computed the complexity score. In the example above, the database has a complexity score of 69 which is ranked as Very High . The thresholds that Adviser uses to convert scores to ranks have been set after working with many customers over many years, but if they don't make sense for your organization then it is possible to customize them. See the Complexity section under Settings for details. The Complexity Score is computed by assigning a complexity score to each type of complexity (e.g. the presence of script libraries) and then summing the scores. In the bar chart above, for example, you can see that Script Libraries are contributing a score of 20 whereas Folders are contributing a score of 4. Summing all the scores in the chart gives the total, 69. Common Problems The Common Problems section shows which common problems were encountered in the database, along with a count of how many design elements were affected by each one. These common problems represent Domino features that are difficult to recreate in other development environments. While we recommend using the full default set, you can configure which common problems to include in the Complexity section of the Settings page. See the relevant documentation for details.

Complexity information is not discarded if it has been collected previously. A message is displayed on the Complexity panel for a database when complexity information is out of date, or has not been recorded because of filtering. Excluding a Database You can create a filter to exclude a database from the database details view in any module. With the required database selected, click the 'no entry' button that is next to the module buttons. This will display the filter menu. The filter menu will let you ignore this specific database on the current server, this database pathname on any server, the folder in which the database resides (if applicable), all replicas of this database or all databases inheriting from the same template as this database, if appropriate. If you select a template, the filter menu will only offer the option of filtering all databases inheriting from the template: modules other than the catalog never display data for templates in any case.

The recommendation is based on a combination of the application usage, the design complexity and the business value. The recommendation can take one of four values. Retain The application is important to your organization and needs to be retained. If you are planning on continuing to run a Domino server, these are the applications that should remain on that server. If you are migrating to a new platform, these are the applications that should be migrated. This is usually a lengthy and expensive course of action and is only recommended for applications with very high business value and usage. Archive The application contains valuable data that should still be available to your users, but a read-only archive is probably enough. You can use Teamstudio Export to create a standalone, read-only, HTML view of the application that can easily be navigated by users using only a browser. Retire The application can be backed up based on your data retention requirements and removed. Generic The application can be replaced with an off-the-shelf product. Simple discussion databases or document libraries are an excellent example of generic applications. Adviser does not currently make this recommendation automatically as, for example, it has no way of knowing that a particular collection of databases are implementing a CRM system. You can, however, set this recommendation manually. Guidance is updated automatically whenever any of the data on which it depends is updated. As it involves examining data for all of the databases in the system it may take a little while to run, so it runs as a background task. See Jobs for further details. The only exception is when you update the business value for a single database: in this case Adviser can immediately update the recommendation for the affected database. Guidance Overview The Guidance overview page is shown when you select Guidance from the navigation bar at the top of the screen. It shows a summary of the databases in your system categorized by the recommendation. As with most charts in Adviser, you may choose to view the data as a pie chart, bar chart or table. Viewing Database Details To view details for a specific database, select the databases button at the top of the screen. Clicking the button will display a complete list of databases. You can sort the list by clicking on any column header and use the search box to limit the display to databases that match the search expression. You can search on any column, so you can enter a server name or guidance recommendation here, not just a file name or title. The down arrow next to the databases button allows you to list databases categorized by server, template or guidance result. Clicking on a specific database will show you details for that database. The Guidance Factors panel shows the metrics that contribute to the recommendation. Note that the guidance recommendation is always shown at the top right of the details area with a light blue background. The recommendation is shown regardless of which module you are currently viewing. Overriding the Automatic Recommendation There may be situations where you want to override the automatic recommendation that Adviser has generated.

The recommendation is based on a combination of the application usage, the design complexity and the business value. The recommendation can take one of four values. Retain The application is important to your organization and needs to be retained. If you are planning on continuing to run a Domino server, these are the applications that should remain on that server. If you are migrating to a new platform, these are the applications that should be migrated. This is usually a lengthy and expensive course of action and is only recommended for applications with very high business value and usage. Archive The application contains valuable data that should still be available to your users, but a read-only archive is probably enough. You can use Teamstudio Export to create a standalone, read-only, HTML view of the application that can easily be navigated by users using only a browser. Retire The application can be backed up based on your data retention requirements and removed. Generic The application can be replaced with an off-the-shelf product. Simple discussion databases or document libraries are an excellent example of generic applications. Adviser does not currently make this recommendation automatically as, for example, it has no way of knowing that a particular collection of databases are implementing a CRM system. You can, however, set this recommendation manually. Guidance is updated automatically whenever any of the data on which it depends is updated. As it involves examining data for all of the databases in the system it may take a little while to run, so it runs as a background task. See Jobs for further details.

Usage data can only be imported if the Usage Auditor application's server configurations were set to Save Supporting Data during data collection. Adviser relies on the full detail of the supporting data files to enable advanced filtering options. Requirements Adviser imports usage collected in previous versions of Usage Auditor using the source files that Usage Auditor collected during scans to create usage reports. Usage Auditor only saves these source files for servers where the server configuration was configured to Save Supporting Data . This setting appears on the server documents and can be viewed by going to Admin > Server Configuration in the Usage Auditor database. In order to import usage, the following conditions must be met. Usage Auditor was configured to Save Supporting Data during scans. A copy of the Usage Auditor database is available on the Adviser workstation (the Notes client workstation configured to process jobs for the desired instance of Adviser.) All servers defined in Usage Auditor have also been defined in Adviser. All servers to be imported must be successfully cataloged by Adviser scans prior to import (see Skipping Servers below for information on limiting what is imported.) Adviser supports importing the file formats from Usage Auditor versions 4 and 5. Note It is important to verify that all servers for which data will be imported have been successfully scanned by Adviser prior to importing. If Usage Auditor contains usage data for servers that are enabled in Adviser but have never been cataloged by Adviser, all databases will be created, however they will be marked as deleted, and minimal catalog information will be available for those databases. Additionally, the proper resolution of HTTP requests to databases depends on a prior catalog scan. A subsequent scan of the server will correctly update deleted status for NSF access, but web usage data cannot be corrected. Creating a backup of the Adviser database prior to importing Usage Auditor data is recommended. Verifying Saved Supporting Data Usage Auditor contains a view, Supporting Data , that can be accessed from the View > Go To menu. This view contains the raw files that Adviser will import. The view is categorized on the date on which the data was collected, and the attachment names listed in the view include the name of the server from which the data was collected. Adviser will import data for the date ranges available in this view. To limit the amount of data imported to Adviser, make a copy of Usage Auditor and delete older entries as desired. Gaps in the dates of these files indicate that either Save Supporting Data was disabled during the time of the gap, or Usage collection failed to run (e.g. due to the Usage workstation being shut off.) In Usage Auditor 5.x, data is collected for all available activity on the server since the last successful scan; gaps smaller than 10 days should not represent missing data. In 4.x, data was collected nightly for the prior day only. If there are significant gaps (more than 10 days in 5.x), limiting the import to the data available after the gaps will improve accuracy, but shorten the reporting period. Skipping Servers Adviser requires all servers in the import data to be defined in Adviser and successfully scanned prior to import. If the Usage Auditor data to be imported contains data for servers that are no longer available, or that otherwise should not be imported, create server definitions for those servers in Adviser, and disable them. Importing Usage Auditor Data Use the following steps to import Usage Auditor data into Adviser. 1. Create a backup copy of the Adviser database; in the event of a failure or misconfiguration, a backup can be used to restore Adviser. 2. Copy the Usage Auditor database to the Adviser workstation client. 3. Review the Supporting Data view in Usage Auditor (as described above.) 4. Create server definitions in Adviser to match Usage Auditor, if needed. Disable any servers that should not be imported. 5. Run an Adviser scan (from the Settings > Servers page of the Adviser browser UI), and verify that it completes successfully. 6. Open the Adviser server application in the Notes client on the Adviser Workstation, and start the import by choosing the Usage Auditor database via Actions > Upgrade / Reimport Usage . The import operation will run as an Adviser job (similar to scans triggered in the UI), and can be monitored in the browser UI by reloading the browser app. If the import is not successful, Adviser can be restored from the backup copy. Note, however, that additional operations are required to reset the Usage statistics in SQL tables that Adviser uses to generate Usage information. For more information, contact Teamstudio support at techsupport@teamstudio.com . Importing Both 4.x and 5.x Usage Auditor Usage Notes and Domino timestamps are stored with 100th of a second precision, and Usage Auditor 5.x records server activity with that same precision. Adviser uses the timestamp of activity, precise to the 100th of a second, to guarantee the uniqueness the activity it records and imports. It is therefore safe to import overlapping usage data from 5.x as the timestamp constraint prevents duplication. Usage Auditor 4.x collected activity from the Domino server with a timestamp granularity of whole seconds. Importing Usage Auditor 4.x data that overlaps in time range with imported Usage Auditor 5.x data will result in some usage being recorded multiple times.","title":"Importing Data from Usage Auditor"},{"location":"ja/importing/#importing-data-from-usage-auditor","text":"If you are upgrading to Teamstudio Adviser from a recent version of Teamstudio Usage Auditor, you may be able to import the usage collected in Usage Auditor into Adviser.

The Adviser server application provides Adviser's browser-based user interface, generates reports on databases and users for the Adviser modules, and stores all data collected by Adviser. Adviser server is deployed by creating an NSF based the template TSAdviser.ntf on the desired server, and configuring it via web browser. The Adviser Workstation is responsible for collecting the data that forms the basis for the reports generated by the Adviser server. Adviser Workstation is deployed by running an installer (contained in the server NSF) on a workstation installation of HCL Notes. The installed program is configured by the installer to connect to the Adviser server, and remains running to process Adviser scans as needed. Scans are resource intensive processes; running scans from a client workstation limits the impact of Adviser on server performance, and allows easier configuration and access to servers in multiple domains. Upgrading an Existing Installation If you are upgrading an existing installation of Adviser 6.0 or above, you can skip directly to the upgrading section. Otherwise continue to follow the instructions below. HCL Domino Server System Requirements Teamstudio Adviser is supported on all HCL-supported Notes/Domino versions.** The web interface for Teamstudio Adviser can be hosted on Domino servers with the HTTP task enabled. For Domino 8.5.3, the server must have a minimum of Fix Pack 3 installed, and must have Upgrade Pack 1 installed (or equivalent version of the Xpages Extension Library). The required components are included in Domino 9.0 and greater; no additional components are required. The Adviser Workstation can be run on a Notes Client version 8.5.3 and higher (32-bit) running on supported versions of Microsoft Windows. We recommend the most recent Fix Pack version also be installed on the HCL Notes workstation. ** Adviser is known to run well in most 8.5.3+ Notes/Domino environments, however, Teamstudio support may be limited regarding issues related to unsupported versions of Notes or Domino. Prerequisites for Usage Data Collection The Usage module of Adviser aggregates and reports on data collected by the HCL Domino server\u2019s Activity Logging task. In order to use Usage Auditor, Activity Logging will need to be enabled and running on the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned by the Adviser application. Below are the instructions for enabling Activity Logging for your HCL Domino server(s): Open the Domino Directory on the server(s) that will be scanned by Teamstudio Adviser. Navigate to the View Configuration -> Servers -> Configurations . If a document already exists for the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned then place the document into Edit mode. If there is not a document for the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned then click the \u201cAdd Configuration\u201d Action button. If this is a new document then list the HCL Domino server(s) the will be scanned by Teamstudio Adviser. If you are intending on scanning multiple HCL Domino servers then you can list them all here. Switch to the Activity Logging tab and ensure that Activity Logging is enabled. In the \u201cEnabled logging types\u201d field ensure that the following options are selected: Domino.AGENT Domino.HTTP Domino.Notes.Database Domino.Notes.Session Save and close the document. This will also enable the Activity Logging task on the HCL Domino server(s) that you listed. If you listed multiple HCL Domino servers on the document you must make sure that the Domino Directory is replicated to the additional servers. By default, Activity Logging is stored the log.nsf database on the HCL Domino server, and the retention period for log.nsf applies to activity as well. By default, Adviser will collect usage data every night and will import any new data. If collection fails, no data will be lost as long as the problem is resolved within the retention period. Installing and Configuring Teamstudio Adviser Application Acquiring the Teamstudio Adviser Application Template The Teamstudio Adviser application is comprised of two parts. The Teamstudio Adviser Domino application file (.NSF.) The Teamstudio Adviser Workstation client (command line interface.) Both of these parts are contained within an HCL Domino Template file which can be obtained from the Teamstudio Website at the following URL: https://www.teamstudio.com/adviser-download-page . Creating the Teamstudio Adviser Application Once you have acquired the Teamstudio Adviser application template, you can create the Teamstudio Adviser application where the data will be stored. This is a simple process to perform by following the steps below. Move the template file into your HCL Notes Client\u2019s Data directory. From your HCL Notes Client select the following menu option File -> Application -> New... . In the dialog that is presented, enter the following information. Server Select the server where you wish to place the Adviser application. Title This is normally Teamstudio Adviser . File name This is normally TSAdviser.nsf . You can also indicate a subdirectory at the beginning of the file name (e.g., Teamstudio\\TSAdviser.nsf .) Template Select the Teamstudio Adviser template from the list. Once these options have been entered you can press OK to create the application. Once the application has been created it will automatically launch into your HCL Notes client. You may receive a Certificate Warning message. This is due to the fact that the design of the Teamstudio Adviser application is currently signed by a Teamstudio ID. To re-sign with your organization\u2019s Notes Signature follow the steps below. Open your HCL Domino Administrator application. Switch to the HCL Domino server where you created the Teamstudio Adviser application. From the Files tab, locate the Teamstudio Adviser application. Right click on the Teamstudio Adviser application and select Sign... In the dialog that is presented, select either Active User\u2019s ID if you are using a Notes ID which has the ability to properly sign designs on the server or optionally select Active Server\u2019s ID to sign the design with the HCL Domino server\u2019s ID file. Click OK to complete the process. Design signing on the HCL Domino server will take approximately 1-5 minutes. If installation is successful, you should see the application home screen similar to the image below. Transaction Logging If Domino Transaction Logging is enabled on the server where the Adviser server NSF is deployed, be sure to disable it for the Adviser database by checking Disable transaction logging in the Advanced tab of the database properties dialog. Transaction Logging is not needed for adviser since scans can be safely repeated if there is an error or outage. Enabling transaction logging may cause problems on the server, since the large number of updates Adviser makes while updating its documents can cause the transaction logs to hit size limits. Access Control List (ACL) By default, Teamstudio Adviser server requires that the ACL entry Anonymous be defined as No Access and given the privilege Read Public Documents \u2013 this setting allows the Adviser workstation to trigger server-side job processing when client-side jobs have completed. Anonymous access cannot be used to create jobs or access data. Anonymous should not be set to a higher level of access, as authentication is required by the Adviser services that support the web browser application. Allowing anonymous higher levels of access will prevent the server from requiring authentication. If the environment does not allow Anonymous access (for example, it is prohibited at the server level via the Directory's Server document), it is possible to configure Adviser to store and use an HTTP Username/Password combination for this access. For more information, contact Teamstudio support at techsupport@teamstudio.com. In general, other ACL settings in Adviser are applied to the browser application in the same manner they are applied in traditional Notes applications. The -Default- access setting can be used to assign any level of access desired in place of anonymous access. Scheduling Daily Scans Since Adviser extracts activity data from the server's log.nsf, which typically keeps 7-10 days of data, it is important to run Usage Scans on a regular basis to ensure the data is up-to-date and without gaps. To ensure that overnight scans occur, within the Teamstudio Adviser application there is a scheduled agent that needs to be enabled. To enable this Scheduled Agent follow the steps below. Locate the newly created Teamstudio Adviser application on you HCL Notes Workspace. Right click on the Teamstudio Adviser application and from the menu that is presented select Application -> Go To Agents . In the list of Agents, locate and select the agent Scheduled Nightly Scan . At the top of the Agents list, click on the button labeled Enable . You can now close your HCL Domino Designer. By default, this agent will run once daily, at 1:00 AM. The run time can be modified to another time if desired. The Schedule Nightly Scan agent initiates the same process as triggering a manual scan using the Scan Now button in the application. The scan will update Catalog information, import Usage since the last scan, and recalculate any affected metrics. Workstation processing must be enabled for the scan request to be processed. Configuration The final step in configuring the Teamstudio Adviser server is to select the servers to scan. You can do this from the Settings page in the web application, accessed via the gear icon on the right of the Adviser navigation bar. See Servers for more details. Installing the Adviser Workstation HCL Notes Client Workstation Prerequisites In order for the Teamstudio Adviser application to collect the data from your HTML Domino server(s) an application must be installed onto a computer where an HCL Notes Client is also installed. This computer will require the following HCL Notes Client configuration. Version V8.5.3 with the most recent Fix Pack, Version 9.0.1 with a minimum of Fix Pack 6, or any newer version. Authenticated with a Notes ID file which has Full Administration access to the HCL Domino server(s) that will be scanned and where the Teamstudio Adviser application will reside. The Security option Don\u2019t prompt for a password from other Notes-based programs enabled. This setting can be located under the HCL Notes menu File -> Security -> User Security... . Note Due to the complexity of the Teamstudio Adviser Workstation client\u2019s scanning tasks it is highly recommended that a dedicated computer, either physical or virtual, is used. The computer that is chosen must also be able to remain running without any restarts or being logged off for 24 hours/day 7 days /week. The Adviser Workstation application is an executable application that run scans from a client workstation. Scanning for and reporting on activity is a resource intensive activity that may access multiple servers and works with file system files as part of the process. The data collected during the Workstation scans is written to the server application, and available via the web browser interface. Adviser Workstation is intended to run continuously, as it monitors the Adviser Server component, waiting for scans to be scheduled. The application must be run by an ID that has a least Reader access to the log.nsf files on the servers to be scanned, as well as any applications for which Complexity data is desired. If the servers exist in multiple domains, the ID and local workstation must be properly cross-certified to all servers. The ID must also have Editor level ACL access (with delete rights) to the Adviser Server application. Installation On the computer where the Adviser workstation will run, log in to the HCL Notes client with the ID that will be used to collect data. Ensure that the Notes client setting Don't prompt for password from other Notes-based programs is checked ( File > Security > User Security... ). This step is required to allow the Adviser Workstation application to run. Open the Adviser server application in the Notes client, and click on the link to enable workstation processing in the section titled Adviser Workstation. The Adviser Workstation installer program will launch. Follow the prompts to install the program. During setup, a settings page will be shown which contains configuration information for the Adviser Workstation and its connection to the server. Verify the information is correct. When the installation is complete, the installer will offer to launch the Adviser Workstation application. Launching the Adviser Workstation Once installed, the Adviser Workstation can be launched by clicking the same link used to install it, found in the Configuration page of the Adviser application in the section titled Adviser Workstation . The Adviser Workstation can also be launched by running the executable Workstation.exe, which is installed by default at <Program Files (x86)>\\Teamstudio\\Adviser Workstation\\Workstation.exe Once launched, the Adviser Workstation application window should open, and begin monitoring for pending scans. Note The Adviser Workstation application needs to continue running at all times to ensure that the scanning processes run to completion. These run every day at 1AM (server time). In order to provide an accurate representation of the User Usage for the HCL Domino server(s) being scanned we recommend that this continue for a minimum of 30 days. Server Connectivity The Adviser Workstation requires connectivity to the Adviser server via HTTP. Most workstation processing, including scanning servers and databases, and writing data to the Adviser server, is handled through the Notes client and NRPC. In order to trigger server processing once client side jobs have completed, Adviser invokes a REST service endpoint via HTTP to ensure that the server application is running to process the updated data. The default workstation configuration attempts to connect to the server based on the fully-qualified host name specified first in the server document in the server's address book. The connection is attempted without SSL on port 80. For servers requiring SSL connections, or connectivity on an alternate port, the configuration can be modified by editing the HTTP Host Name field in the Workstation Configuration document in the workstation database. By default this field contains only the host name, but a protocol and optional port name can be specified (for example, https://teamstudio.com:499 specifies SSL on port 499). The Notes client acting as the Adviser Workstation must be exited completely and restarted for this setting to take effect. For help configuring these settings, contact Teamstudio support. Due to limitations with the Java 6 JVM currently embedded in Notes, SSL that use large key sizes may not work correctly. If Anonymous connections are disallowed on the server hosting Adviser, the Workstation can be optionally configured to use HTTP authentication credentials. The user name and password used for login are reversibly hashed to prevent casual access, and stored in a Notes database locally on the workstation in fields encryped with the current ID. To enable the use of authentication, use the command \"http auth\" from the workstation console ( help http auth prints command usage.) Console Commands The Adviser Workstation supports a limited number of administrative commands from the console. To view a list of enabled commands, type help at the console. If additional usage information has been provided for a command, typing help <command> will display it. Upgrading Adviser To upgrade from a previous version of Adviser 6.0 or greater, follow the steps below. Upgrade Adviser Server Sign the new template with the appropriate ID to execute code on the target server. Refresh the design of the server Adviser database from the new template. Restart the HTTP task on the server using the command restart task http . This is equivalent to quit http followed by load http - note that tell http restart will not fully release the JVM and update the new code. Upgrade Adviser Workstation 6.2 or later Exit the Adviser Workstation application, if running. Uninstall Adviser Workstation from the Windows Add / Remove Programs control panel. Install the new Adviser Workstation from the Configuration page in the Adviser server NSF, following the instructions above Upgrade Adviser Workstation 6.1 or earlier The Adviser Workstation install prior to 6.2 ran the workstation component as a locally scheduled agent in the Notes client, from the Notes application TSAdviserWS.nsf located in the root of the Notes data directory. To upgrade, follow these steps. Exit the Notes client acting as the workstation completely (this can be confirmed using task manager). Delete TSAdviserWs.nsf from the client's data directory. Restart the Notes client and open the Adviser Server application. Follow the instructions above for installing Adviser Workstation. In the browser UI, schedule a new scan. This will update the data as needed for the new version, and enable any new features. It is safe to schedule a scan while waiting for the workstation to restart; the scan will begin once the workstation is active. If you have been running a previous Beta version of Adviser Workstation 6.2, which runs as a command-line application, exit the application and install the new Workstation application by following the instructions above. Depending on the version, you may be prompted to uninstall Adviser Workstation via Windows' Programs and Features control panel prior to installing the new version. Browsers and Saved Passwords Adviser does not currently support using saved passwords in browsers. Previously saved passwords can be removed via the browser's settings page. Importing Usage Data from Usage Auditor Usage data from Teamstudio Usage Auditor can be imported if the setting Save Supporting Data was enabled during the period of usage collection.

Most workstation processing, including scanning servers and databases, and writing data to the Adviser server, is handled through the Notes client and NRPC. In order to trigger server processing once client side jobs have completed, Adviser invokes a REST service endpoint via HTTP to ensure that the server application is running to process the updated data. The default workstation configuration attempts to connect to the server based on the fully-qualified host name specified first in the server document in the server's address book. The connection is attempted without SSL on port 80. For servers requiring SSL connections, or connectivity on an alternate port, the configuration can be modified by editing the HTTP Host Name field in the Workstation Configuration document in the workstation database. By default this field contains only the host name, but a protocol and optional port name can be specified (for example, https://teamstudio.com:499 specifies SSL on port 499). The Notes client acting as the Adviser Workstation must be exited completely and restarted for this setting to take effect. For help configuring these settings, contact Teamstudio support. Due to limitations with the Java 6 JVM currently embedded in Notes, SSL that use large key sizes may not work correctly. If Anonymous connections are disallowed on the server hosting Adviser, the Workstation can be optionally configured to use HTTP authentication credentials. The user name and password used for login are reversibly hashed to prevent casual access, and stored in a Notes database locally on the workstation in fields encryped with the current ID.

It has four modules: Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance. Catalog The Catalog module reads information from your Domino server catalogs and address books to provide core lists of databases, templates, users and groups. You can use the catalog to browse your databases by name, server, template or how recently they have been modified. You can use the Effective Access feature to determine which users have access to which databases even when the ACL contains complex group structures. In addition to information pulled from the server catalog, this module also allows you to set a Business Value, from 1-5, for each database trapping its importance to your organization. Lastly, the catalog module allows you to configure filters to exclude certain databases and users from the other modules. More details are available in the catalog documentation. Usage The Usage module imports usage information from your Domino server logs and displays detailed usage statistics for both users and databases. For a database, you can see how many times it was accessed and by whom, along with historical trends showing whether the usage is increasing or decreasing. For a user, you can see which databases and servers they accessed. More details are available in the usage documentation. Complexity The Complexity module scans the complete designs of the databases on your servers and generates a complexity score from 1-5 measuring the approximate difficulty of migrating this application to another platform. The score is based on a number of factors including the size of the design and the numbers of different types of design elements, along with counts of specific Domino features that are hard to migrate. You can also specify keywords whose presence suggest that migration may be hard. These include, for example, references to other proprietary internal systems or external code in DLLs.

New Features Directory Support in Filters The parent directory of a selected database can now be filtered using the Filter button dropdown, allowing the filter to be applied to all databases in the directory on the current server or on all servers. See Filters for more information on filtering. Complexity and Filtered Databases When databases are filtered in Adviser, the complexity scan will no longer create/update complexity information for those databases. Combined with directory filtering, this can be a huge performance benefit during initial scans. This operation is non-destructive; complexity data is not discarded, out-dated complexity information is flagged in the UI, and removing the filter can allow complexity to be updated in future scans. Log UI Improvements The Logs pane in the browser app has been improved to show stack traces when clicking on error messages, display more accurate by-date grouping across time zones, and to better allow copying of text in log entries. Upgrading Upgrading from Adviser 6.x Upgrading Adviser involves refreshing or replacing the design of the server database, updating the command-line module on the workstation and restarting the server's HTTP task. See Upgrading Adviser on the installation page for a detailed list of steps. Upgrading from Adviser 5.x It is possible to upgrade from Usage Auditor 5.0 and retain all collected Usage data. Note that data collected with versions of Usage Auditor prior to 5.0 cannot be imported into Adviser. To ensure a successful upgrade, please contact our tech support team for help with your migration.

It allows you to view information about how much your databases are being used and who is using them. It distinguishes between web and client usage and also separates usage by individual users from usage by agents or servers. Running Usage Scan The Domino server only retains usage information for fourteen days so it is important that you run usage scans regularly to import the data before it is lost. The installation section explains how to configure Teamstudio Adviser to run a usage scan every night. Viewing Usage Data To view usage data, select Usage from the top navigation bar or click on the Usage section of the Adviser home page. This will display the Usage overview page. This shows the databases with the most usage and the most active users, along with the last few scans. You can use the buttons next to each chart to view the data as a pie chart, a bar chart or a table. You can use the scan history to verify that your servers are being scanned successfully. Viewing Database Usage To view a list of databases, click the Databases button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the databases on all your servers. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to databases matching the search text. All of the columns are searched, so you can, for example, match on a database title, not just a database path. The counts in the table are defined as follows. | Column Name | Description | |---|---| | User Total | The total number of hits for the database by users i.e. excluding hits from servers and agents. This is the sum of the Notes and Web columns. | | Notes | The number of times the database was used by users from a Notes client. This is a count of sessions : when a user opens a database, interacts with it from the Notes client and then closes it, that counts as a single session. | | Web | The number of times the database was accessed by users via HTTP. Since HTTP does not have a concept of sessions, this is a count of individual database accesses. For example, opening a page to view a single document might involve several database accesses to retrieve graphics stored as image resources in the database. Therefore the counts in this column tend to be significantly larger than the counts in the Notes column. | | Days | The number of unique days on which the database was accessed by at least one user. Again, server and agent hits are excluded. | | Users | The number of unique users who accessed the database. | Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the databases in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Databases button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data, such as by template or by server. For example, if you group by template, you will see a screen like the following. To the left, a list of templates is shown, along with how many databases use that template. Selecting a template will display a list of those databases. Grouping by Replica ID Databases in Usage views can also be grouped by Replica ID, to give a clearer picture of database usage across multiple replicating servers. When this option is enabled, the server column will display the number of servers the database was found on, and the row will show combined usage totals for all replicas. The file name and title, if not identical on all replicas, will also show the number of replicas. Clicking on this row will expand it so that statistics for individual replicas can be viewed. Viewing Database Usage Details To view the usage details for a database, simply select the database from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the database list on the left and the details of the selected database on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the database. Teamstudio Adviser will remember which section you have expanded so that you will see a consistent view as you navigate through the application. Usage Counts The Usage Counts section, shown above, shows the counts available from the table along with additional counts for database accesses by agents and by servers. Users The Users section shows which users have accessed the database. The count, 48 in the screenshot, shows how many different users have accessed the database. Agents The Agents section shows which agents have accessed the database. The count, 1 in the screenshot, shows how many different agents have accessed the database. Trends The Trends section shows historical monthly counts for notes and web database access by users. As usual, server and agent accesses are excluded from these counts. You can view details from other modules using the row of buttons above the details. These will switch between Catalog, Usage, Complexity and Guidance details. The last button is used to filter the database - see Filters for details. If the list that you were viewing was grouped then you will see an additional control at the top left of the screen that allows you to navigate through the groups. This control has buttons with left and right arrows that allow you to navigate to the previous and next groups. You can also click on the central text with the group name to select from a dropdown list of all groups. Keyboard Navigation There are several keyboard shortcuts to help you navigate around the details view. Up and Down arrows will move to the previous and next databases in the list. Left and Right arrows will cycle through the different modules. Viewing User Usage To view a list of users, click the Users button at the top of the screen. By default, this will display a list of all of the users with any recorded database access. As with any list in Teamstudio Adviser, you can click on any of the column headers to sort the data. You can also use the search box to limit the display to users matching the search text. The counts in the table are defined as follows. | Column Name | Description | |---|---| | Total Hits | The total number of database accesses recorded for this user. See the database section above for details on how these this count is computed. | | Servers Accessed | The number of different servers accessed by this user. | | Last Access | The last day on which activity was found for this user. | Instead of viewing a complete list, you can group the users in various ways. To do this, click on the down arrow at the right of the Databases button at the top of the screen. This will offer several ways to group the data, such as by data of last access. For example, if you group by template, you will see a screen like the following. Viewing Usage Usage Details To view the usage details for a user, simply select the user from any list. This will display the details screen. This screen shows the user list on the left and the details of the selected user on the right. You can expand the sections to view different types of data about the user.

User Details The User Details section, shown above, shows the same summary information available in the list. Databases The Databases section shows which databases the user has accessed. The count, 28 in the screenshot, shows how many different databases the user has accessed. Servers The Servers section shows which servers the user has accessed.
